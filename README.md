The **rmdexamples** package illustrates various techniques for extending [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The examples included here are described in more detail in the article on [Shiny Widgets](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny_widgets.html).

To try out rmdexamples locally you should first install the development versions of the **htmltools**, **knitr**, and **shiny** packages. You can do this as follows:

```r
devtools::install_github(c("rstudio/htmltools", "yihui/knitr", "rstudio/shiny"))
```

Then to install rmdexamples:

```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/rmdexamples")
```
